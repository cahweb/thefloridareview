<div id="storeArea" data-size="84" hidden><div tiddler=" Buildings" tags="night" created="201604062231" modifier="twee" twine-position="1410,290">I begin in Chinatown, where the red lanterns still flicker at midnight, and the arabesque lizards stare out from the walls with dull jade eyes. I cover them with birds, track down the Trojans, draw a bird devouring the “J.” At night, the boys practice parkour near the mahjong tables in Temple Square. They bounce back and forth between the frozen escalators, scale the fiberglass shoes hanging in front of the open-air shopping mall.\n\t\nA boy in black watches as I spray a lopsided bluebird, its head malformed with a bright orange bill.\n\t\n“Maybe,” he says, and his teeth gleam white inside his black balaclava. “Maybe the universe has given you a different talent.” He jumps to grab the sign for the noodle bar, swings his legs to hang upside down from the railing, then grabs a canister from my bag.\n\t\n“Talk to the pixel lady, “ he says, spraying a butterfly in day-glow pink. “She can tell you your fortune, although, as old as you are, you should know it by now.”\n\t\nAcross the square, a woman enters, glowing in a dress made from hundreds of supple screens. They flicker and flash, a barrage of voices. Figures emerge from the shadows, reach for her hands. \n\t\n“Be brave,” the boy calls, spraying butterflies like flower petals as he leaps from a clothesline onto a roof.\n\n[[No need for fortunes. | Fortunes]]\n[[The woman's eyes are dark as movie screens. | Screens]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Overpasses" tags="night" created="201604062231" modifier="twee" twine-position="1410,570">I visit the wastelands, places where concrete and traffic make life untenable, where the only faces are hints and flashes, sudden expressions behind metal and glass. There is no life here, but life passes through without alarm. I hang from bridges and fling spray paint to  approximate the flowers.\n\t\nWhy “Trojan”, I wonder, even as the rain falls and the paint drips. Particles of dirt stick to the color so that it fades even as I'm watching.\n\t\nBecause it was Samara's, I've never liked graffiti, resisted its illicitness and masking, the identity alluded to but never revealed, its tendency to speak in code.\n\t\nNow, though, with the paint drying on my hands, my cuticles dyed pink and red, I understand the allure of discovery, the gleeful announcement that someone has been even here, to the highway where construction has obliterated the shoulder, to the Hayes Bridge where three workers died during construction, even the vast acres of the airport parking lot, where no one lingers, not even for a cigarette.\n\t\nAt night, I often hear footsteps, sirens blaring in the dark. Now, I hear the jangle of handcuffs, the click of a gun snapped out of its holster. Something large charges across the cobblestones.

Once, the crumbling row of brick was an alley of tiny food stalls, cramped windows spewing steam and the scents of skewered meats, now faded to smells and strangely-shaped stains. My sister Samara, eight years older, is barely a name, barely a collection of features that resembles my own, a presence more than a memory, a shape more than an absence. If the map is her city, then it is a different city, a different world that mirrors my own without intersecting. We have both walked these streets, but they have never been the same streets.\n\nYesterday's successful merchants are now figures crouched on squares of cardboard, huddled beneath lizards so faded they might be hieroglyphs. The lizards curl, cerulean and amber at the base of lampposts, olive and magenta around the greening statues outside the shuttered art museum. Inside, the statues must be shrouded in cobwebs, but in Samara's day there would have been ticket-takers and gallery guides, newly applied vellum on the walls.\n\nAt the end of the block, near the tower of stone that once held an insurance agency, my father stumbles in his tattered blue coat. He presses his fingers to the walls, as if he could read painted lizards like braille.\n\n“Are you here?” he shouts, turning his head to look. His eyes focus in different directions, eyes that have always contained the stories of the eyes they would become, milky blue, sheened like oil.\n\n[[I go to him. | Him]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Another2" tags="dimming" created="201604062208" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,10">&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTlrn376T4w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nThe doorbell rings and rings. “Injustices are happening!” my father yells. “Executions are happening!

And so, we never learned whether she was responsible for the lizards painted around the city, or the name &quot;Trojan&quot; with its flowered &quot;J.&quot; \n\nMy father kept her room, dusted the glass turtles and warmed the blue lava lamp. The year I turned fifteen, my mother dismantled everything, sold Samara's guitar, donated every one of her Belle the Babysitter paperbacks. \n\n“My eyes,” my father complained. Already the colors were leaving him. But by then Samara's room was a foldout couch and the smallest television, the tilting red lamp passed down from my grandfather.\n\n“Have you done your chores?” my mother asked me as she settled into the business of dying. What she meant was I was not going anywhere.\n\nWe never told her that Samara left behind two diaries. My father and I secreted them away. I kept third through fifth grade, a ratty notation of preferred meals: spaghetti and barbecue cups, a careful recording of her favorite friends: Hilde the Green Ninja (73 points) and worst enemies: Slimy Tobias (-113 points). My father has sixth grade through ninth grade, and he fingers the pages, feels the creases for the ghosts of letters.\n\n“She planned to go to sea,” he says, holding up a spiral notebook labeled “The Most Boring Things.” But when I push aside his fingers, she describes only a theater audition, a phone call she'd gotten from Arial, Unicorn Killer (52 points) asking if it was okay to date Patrick, the Most Beautiful Painter (268 points). \n\nHidden in the wasteland of my father's bedroom, “The Most Boring Things,” must smell of peppermint and Vapor-Rub, and maybe Samara is still documenting, online, like everyone, cataloguing dinners and disappointments, assigning all of us a score.\n\n[[I search my father's room for “The Most Boring Things.” | Boring]]\n[[I search online for a blog by Samara. |Blogs]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Burn" tags="twilight" created="201604062225" modifier="twee" twine-position="1550,10">&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ID3W7pFll68&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nAs the video plays, Tomas offers one tiny figure after another.

Skeptics place the tree folk with Johnny Appleseed and Babe the Blue Ox, but the truth is the city's forests have airborne hovels, braided branches, rickety platforms lashed from vines.\n\t\nThe city's slogan is “Paradise Among Branches,” and before the great fires, the downtown was filled with trees, their leaves and seedpods clogging the drains. The Great Church of the Canopy believes we will all one day go back there. One day we will regrow our tails, discover our latent talents for climbing.\n\t\nWhen someone disappears, it's always rumored she's returned to the forest, grown naked and feral, hair tangled with insects, but my father has never checked the woods.\n\t\n“No daughter of mine,” he says. “No monkey person is a daughter of mine.”\n\t\nOne day, the story goes, we'll wake to a yearning. Our shoes and clothes will feel suffocating, constricting, our language limiting, the sky too far.\n\t\n“Why not explore every option?” I ask, but my father marches over stone and pine bark, brandishes his cane at the gray, hanging sky.\n\t\nHe's always been strong, but the trees dwarf my father, seem to shift their roots to trip his feet. He walks on, despite the stumbling. Lifts his head in the driving rain. In darkness, he cries out at forest nightmares, but the branches claw, and he does not bow his head.\n\n[[I take him home. | Home]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Another4" tags="shadows" created="201604062218" modifier="twee" twine-position="1410,10">&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/81751802?color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/81751802&quot;&gt;War Paint for Trees&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/frostjeff&quot;&gt;Jeff Frost&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n“In the beauty of the lilies,” he sings, softly. “So much of growing old involves trying to look through the fear to the wonder beyond.” His hands shake so hard he drops the phone. “Some days,” he tells the lamppost. “Some days, I almost manage it.”\n\n[[I take him home. | Home]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Cemetery" tags="shadows" created="201604062217" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,290">“A cemetery,” I tell him, because he will want to complain. “Not a sculpture garden.” But he's already too far, using the feel of the gravel to guide his way. He circles the stone crosses, ducks under pine trees distilling rain onto lichen-covered tombstones.\n\t\nTo the unfamiliar, the cemetery could seem like a military sculpture garden, the size and heft of the tombstones indicators of accomplishment and rank. The font and chiseling might share the secrets of status, the heft and pressure clues to the manner of death. The crying angel might have been a woman who ranked highly as a mother before losing her children to the haze of dementia. The marble pyramid suggests a scholar, waging war between the fresh-bound copies of his own books, who died of a heart attack, pencil in hand.\n\t\n“I've found the POW koi pond!” my father shouts, holding to the railing of the McDonough family mausoleum. “The infantry rose gardens must be nearby.”\n\t\nThe tombstones at his feet are all marred by graffiti: flowered Trojans, and arabesque lizards, tags and symbols, stenciled tigers, scrawled figures with colored eyes. The mayor's anti-graffiti forces might have tried to bury them all, as if sandblasting and fines couldn't be enough.\n\t\n“You're standing on graves,” I say, but he doesn't hear me. He brushes a chubby cherub's cheeks.\n\t\n“Lieutenant Despard?” he asks it. “General Lee?”\n\n[[I find hauntings on my phone. | Hauntings]]\n[[I lead him to the weeping fountain. | Fountain]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Photos" tags="dimming" created="201604062200" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,10">My father has never gone digital. His photography has spawned mountains of film canisters, miles of negative strips. In his workroom, binders full of contact sheets tilt and tower. He's kept every test strip, every bracketed experiment, every sepia wash and dodging tool. \n\t\nNow the doctors have started in with “test phase” suggestions, new technologies in experimental phases. “We could mimic your sight,” they say, “implant a microchip. It won't be real sight, but something similar.”\n\t\nMy father laughs. He has never heard the click of a digital shutter, never considered histograms or Adobe Photoshop. \n\t\n“Can you imagine,” he says, rolling sightless eyes at their suggestions. “If in the end, I become a robot.”\n\t\n“Become?” I'd like to ask, but there are kindnesses owed the old.\n\t\nThe binders labeled “Samara” are filled with walls instead of people, and I remember the smell of the paint in her room, the drop cloths and canisters, Sharpies and stencils. \t\n\nSamara's art was my father's biggest failure, and yet he's spent his seeing years photographing graffiti, the arabesques and signatures, caricatures and slogans, the whole careers of illicit artists. He's certain the lizards are hers, the tiny scrolls embroidering the scales, or else the sprayer, “Trojan,” with the flowered “J.” \n\t\n“She'd want everyone to know she was a girl,” my father said.\n\t\n“Woman,” I did say, that time.\n\n[[I search for lizards. | Lizards]]\n[[I look online for flowered “J”s. | J]]\n</div><div tiddler="Start" tags="open" created="201604062158" modifier="twee" twine-position="8,710">&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;//City of Cobwebs//&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;//Julialicia Case//&lt;/div&gt;\n\n[[Begin | Beginning]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Reassurance" tags="dimming" created="201604062206" modifier="twee" twine-position="430,430">As soon as the snow melts, my father turns himself outdoors, channels his own mother, throws himself outside. He sits on the porch and whittles the firewood while the angry March winds stiffen his fingers.\n\t\n“Samara thought you knew her,” I say, throwing open the screen door before his sightless eyes can dissuade me. “You were the only one who made her feel like a person.”\n\t\nMy father's porch chair is empty, the knife still quivering, sunk into the wooden sign that says “Welcome.” The wind brings a quavering voice, a distant tremor from down the street, a fluttering blue coat with tattered sleeves.\n\t\n“Admit you've seen her,” my father accuses an abandoned shopping cart. “You know her,” he address the empty Holy Family parking lot. “You know she's here, somewhere, in the city.” The parking spots pay him no mind, are distracted by the nun unlatching the gate.\n\t\n“We all meander toward Armageddon,” a homeless woman tells the statue of John the Baptist.\n\t\nMy father fingers the brickwork, feels for traces of Samara's graffiti.\n\t\n“You really saw her,” I mean to say, but my words go another way. “Old man,” I say. “You old, blind man.”\n\n[[I go to him. | Him]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Promenade" tags="shadows" created="201604062213" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,430">The East Promenade is a narrow boardwalk, rotting and shaking. I guide my father to the handrails. His legs tremble in the cold wind. The arcades sit empty and shadowed. If these once were games, they've been boarded up, packed away with crates of unclaimed prizes. My father stumbles over a deflated basketball, and I grab his shoulders, resist the urge to try and heft him.\n\t\n“I hear music,” he says, pushing forward, kicking up sawdust.\n\t\n“You're imagining,” I say, twice, before he hears me.\n\t\n“All of these people,” he says, waving a hand at the empty walkway. “These parents don't know they're in the wasteland of child rearing. Your family is a journey you travel on your own.”\n\t\nAn ancient carousel hulks in the darkness, the animals rusty and as blind as my father. “Such music!” he says. “Such wonderful music!”\n\t\n“What music?” I ask, though it's true the wind howls at flaking paint, snarls and digs at the rust. “What music?” I say, but he's stumbling forward, the lights up ahead like a dream coming into focus.\n\n[[Time for a drink. | Drink]]\n[[Time for a snack. | Snack]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Shelters" tags="night" created="201604062238" modifier="twee" twine-position="1830,10">The shelter district is near the refineries, sending their flames up into the night.

The children crowd the front window, wave through the glass as we pass rows of blue tarp tents, the lengthening line for the only dining hall.\n\t\nThe children call the names of missing family members. “John Brian!” They search the crowds of upturned faces for a face that resembles one of their own. “Tasha! Aunt Tasha!”\n\t\n“Sit down,” the parents say. “Let the adults look.” But what need do children have for parents, who can kills dreams so quickly, without remorse?\n\t\n“Samara!” I should call. “Samara!” I should scan the faces for her hair and eyes, but I can't stop looking at the rest of the tram, where the parents take no notice of me, have no interest at all in what I've become.\n\n[[I hurry home. | Hurry]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Distraction" tags="dimming" created="201604062207" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,150">&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ie0EJPcaeSQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nMy father hammers the doorbell and shouts from the porch. “Your sister could pass on the street, and you would never know it.

The “Show Times” board lists no show times, but a blue light glows in the center of the ring when I guide my father through the tent flap, consider the benches arced around the stage.\n\t\n“Do you hear hissing?” My father says. “Snakes are hissing all around us.”\n\t\n“It's nerves,” I say, hearing only the billow and pop of the canvas, the subtle lapping of the lake outside.\n\t\n“I hear pythons,” he says. “I hear mambas and pythons.”\n\t\nThe blue-lit stage is covered in a layer of sawdust, but up above the ropes twist and dangle, almost slither in the dim.\n\t\n“What do you see?” His fingers curl and tighten around my arm. “Why do you never describe what you see?”\n\t\n“I don't know,” I say, but he's too distracted to hear me, whirling at the snapping canvas, the twang of swaying cords and cables.\n\n[[I look for Scylla in the back. | Scylla]]\n[[I divert him with videos on my phone. | Phone]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Him" tags="him" created="201604062202" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,430">My father doesn't notice me until I am upon him, until I touch the sleeves of his tattered coat.\n\t\n“Devil be gone!” he wrenches his arms, but I grab his hands, hold tight to the paper of his thinning skin.\n\t\n“It's me,” I say. “It's only me.”\n\t\n“You are a disappointment,” he says. “You've always been a disappointment.”\n\t\nHis eyes are gone, and his limbs are going. His legs creak and tremble; he holds to the walls. Still he wanders the streets of the city, drags himself onto busses, flashes his senior pass, expired, but who can turn him away?\n\t\nI find him in the courtyards of strange apartment complexes, find him among the homeless, holding cardboard signs at intersections.

There are no stories of a park, and so I go to a park, to the biggest park, the oldest park, walled by smooth stones hauled up from the river. I wander the paths that were never her paths, consider a radio tower that never prompted her to tip her head back to squint at the sky. The rotting picnic tables have never smelled of new, green wood. The crumbling pavilion fireplace was never whole, its fallen chimney never a conduit for smoke.\n\t\nA crimson lizard twines around the thickest wooden beam. Its green eyes gleam as if the paint were still wet. She could be here somewhere, could be at the river, letting the current steal the color from her brushes. Even as I'm thinking it, I see my father in the field, the hem of his blue coat dragging among the weeds.

There, among the robins, the greatest failure of my life has come to pass.\n \n“Because of love,” I say, but he can't see how I address the dogwood, the pink so fierce it is painful, searing sharp and deep.\n \n“Well,” he says. “Just don't try to convince me we've lost her.”\n\n[[I begin with the photographs. | Photos]]\n[[I begin with the diaries. | Diaries]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Me" tags="dimming" created="201604062207" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,430">My father has never remodeled or repainted anything, not the avocado shag carpet, not the kitchen's peeling linoleum, certainly not the bathroom filled with warped wood and bubbled paint.

Could we both look through the window and into the neighbor's algae-colored pool? Perhaps the Samara in the mirror is the closest Samara, the most recognizable one.\n\t\nOut in the yard, my father cracks the croquet mallet, brandishes wickets while pushing past the peonies. “She always loved croquet! Loved it!” The lawn darts are warped, faded relics from the garage, and he flings them away from the lawn, over the chain-link, where they scrape and roll on the asphalt.\n\t\n“Our whole lives are contained in our childhoods!” he yells. “Even our deaths,” he tells the streetlight near the bus stop. “Especially our deaths.”\n\n[[I go to him. | Him]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Scylla" tags="shadows" created="201604062215" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,850">As I approach the purple curtain at the back of the arena, a cloaked figure steps onto the stage. An indigo hood drapes to cover its face, and it raises its hand as if for silence.\n\t\nMy father, of course, doesn't see or hear it. “Snake tongues,” he shouts, clapping his hands to get my attention. “I hear snake tongues from the back!” He struggles to stand, but he can't find his cane. “Are you looking?” he shouts. “Are you checking the back?”\n\t\nAlone in the auditorium, despite the waving and the shouting, he seems small and fragile, barely a child. Onstage, the figure drapes itself with snakes, tendrils of emerald and crimson scaling its arms and torso. The snakes' eyes flare gold and fiery, and the figure's coat glimmers with an arabesque lizard, the kind Samara used to draw as a child. The figure slithers and writhes, arches and seethes. I have only eyes, though, for my father, a pale face in the dark of the room. He waves at the ceiling, calls to the canvas, ignores the figure who ignores him in return.\n\t\n“I hear hissing,” my father shouts. “I know I hear hissing,” but his face is faded, like that of a ghost that doesn't know it is a ghost, yet, like a child not yet aware it's alone in the night.\n\n[[I take him home. | Home]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Raincoat" tags="shadows" created="201604062220" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,150">The dark clouds deepen the shadows of the forest, the arc of the trees and the echo of the rain.

Her dog has two eyes, but hobbles on three legs, and her eyes are a different, brighter blue.\n\t\nWe see her again as we're circling the duck pond. She's taller and thinner, with a hook to her nose. She's walking a cat, and it's missing one ear. “Hello,” she says, as if it's the first time.\n\t\nMy father says nothing, ignores the greetings. He stumbles forward, brushes the leaves. “Where are the sculptures?” he asks. “Where are the statues?” Drops of rain run down his face.\n\t\nEvery so often, I see two other figures among the trees, at the far end of the path: an old man in a blue coat, stumbling and flailing, a younger person who looks like me. At each turn, I expect to run into ourselves, older and thinner, versions molded by different lives. \n\t\n“Wherever you go,” my father says. “The world smells like you.”\n\n[[I take him home. | Home]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Patrick" tags="twilight" created="201604062222" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,10">Patrick has stopped painting, and now he is famous for his carvings: massive beasts constructed with chainsaws and logs. People come to the city just to watch him wield angry metal, to wander the paths of his wooden bestiary. His partner, Tomas, is a renowned horticulturist, a grafter of trees, a cross-pollinator and genetic wizard.\n\t\nThe bestiary blossoms with manufactured trees, blooms bright as stars, fragrance deep as memory. All the plants are infertile, once-in-a-lifetime creations, and they bend and sway among Patrick's creations, the mangled carcasses of the fallen.\n\t\n“If you're hunting Patrick,” says the sign at the gate, “just follow the sound of the chainsaw.”\n\t\nThe paths of the bestiary are made from scattered metal, screws and bolts pressed silver into the dirt.

Even the darkest alleys were thought to be protected by lasers, tripwire, and sirens. “Just try,” the archive says on its homepage. “Try to get away with vandalism.”\n\t\nNow, amid citywide heroin use and skyrocketing unemployment, the archive is the mayor's most embarrassing blemish, an over-told joke about how the richest years spawn the most useless initiatives. But even before that, the taggers scoffed, used the archive as a forum for their messages. Every drawing was a middle finger, a rallying cry to the oppressed. “Try, just try, to stop us.”\n\t\nTrojan was the most successful warrior, the flowered “J” scrawled and sprayed on fountains and skyscrapers. She tagged city hall in three different locations, tagged police and fire stations, public plazas and high school courtyards. The mayor claimed it could never be a single individual, was evidence of widespread legions of the unsavory.

For years, I believed she'd intended them as clues, a map I could follow, a way of saying: You are not abandoned. I might have given them to my parents, but instead I hoarded them, the video game with its flashing animals, the old-fashioned galley boat with its sails and rigging. My parents tried police stations and morgues, but I knew she was thriving, painting the city, building a life in the Docklands or Flashytown. I was certain she was turning into something, becoming someone she could only become without us.\n\t\nNow, on my houseboat, her gifts seem like hurried afterthoughts: an off-brand game with characters made to resemble syndicated ones, a dollar store boat with a cheap plastic anchor. They look like stolen presents, things she found at night, in dumpsters. Instead they say: I have already forgotten you.\n\t\nStill, though, maybe the oldest clues are the most appropriate. Samara loved the bustle and the color of Flashytown, the lapping water and creaking wood of the Docklands. When I moved to the docks, it was partly because the gulls made me think of her, imagine her transformation. If I've avoided Flashytown, it's for the same reason: the constant change, the constant evolution, a scared runaway becoming something unexpected. Who knows what we will find if we find her. Who knows the kind of creature she has become.\n\n[[Visit the Docklands. | Docklands]]\n[[Visit Flashytown. | Flashytown]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Flashytown" tags="twilight" created="201604062226" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,430">The bullet train is fast, but goes only to Flashytown, an underground track that passes in a blur. Once the mayor thought that bullet trains were the future, that they'd connect the city in a network of speed. But when the Flashytown tunnel was complete, no one wanted another line. Instead the city invested in the trolley with its clanging bell, the taxis with their smiling yellow lights.\n\t\nI try to avoid Flashytown with its buildings of windowless steel and sparkling glass, surfaces for projections, advertisements, and images. A rock star hammers his guitar. A football player charges in slow motion. A soda glistens with condensation. Tonight, though, the district is dark, the skyscrapers flat planes of looming shadow. Nothing is darker than a defunct screen.\n\t\nPeople stand on the sidewalks, staring up at the stars, which are the brightest lights now in a sector that has never had a need for streetlights. \n\t\n“When will they change?” I hear a small voice say.\n\t\n“Any minute now,” an older voice answers.\n\t\nIt is too dark to tell who is rich and who is homeless.

Cookies emerge from ovens, edges still sizzling, the chocolate melting.\n\t\nThe briefest cure for hopelessness is a visit to a bakery. Despair fades among éclairs and tiramisu. Misery pales when faced with indulgence.\n\t\nA woman frosts a carrot cake that bursts with nuts and raisins. The cream cheese icing drips and oozes.\n\t\nHow long since my father's house has smelled of sugar? I reach the counter just as the woman has finished piping the carrots along the edge.

So many of the inmates have eyes like my mother's, eyes watery with worry, mouths thin from years of lips pressed with anxiety.\n\t\n“Eighty percent of missing women have new families when we find them,” Torvin says. “Ninety percent have gone on with their lives.”\n\t\nMy mother took pains to leave nothing of herself behind. “I am a life,” she said. “Not a memory.”\n\t\nSomewhere my father, too, is doing last things: eating the last banana, pouring himself a last glass of water.

She made arrangements for cremation, had her ashes shipped to a second cousin removed whom she had never met, and who scattered the remains among the rusted cars of his scrapyard.\n\nWe were left with an outdated telephone book she may have used, a pair of unopened envelopes promising she'd won a sweepstakes.

People die at the docks: monthly drownings, yearly stabbings, weekly inebriated fistfights turned lethal by the treachery of wires and pylons.

Boxes of mixes call for products no longer available: Melt-o-meal, Wholesalt, Sunset Oil. Rusting carts half-filled with abandoned products sit forgotten in the aisles, eerie memorials to vanished consumers.\n\t\nThe loudspeakers play songs I remember, doo-wops and crooners, nothing newer than 1960, and I follow my mother's old path without thinking: bananas, bread, two percent, paper towels, the aisle where Samara always begged for marshmallow cereal, the one where she once pocketed a chocolate bar, the pet aisle where I always asked for a dog.\n\t\n“We'll see,” my mother says, her voice as raspy as the wheels of a shopping cart. “Ask your father.”\n\t\n“I need pencils,” Samara says, “for school tomorrow.” Her voice drifts past the vinegars and mustards like a graveyard wind.\n\t\nThe aisles are empty, wide, with careful rows of ordered packages, but something moves in the neighboring aisle, something massive and weighty, dragging and creaking.

The smell of the markers brings on visions. I see the four of us in a canoe, arguing over paddles, tangling our lines around each other's fishing poles. At the campfire, I sulked over the unfairness of Samara. Our father drifted to the shore with his headphones. Our mother went on solitary walks that lasted for hours. On the way home, we rolled our eyes and slouched, waited for a freedom that never quite came.\n\t\nBy the end, I make the lizards almost perfectly. I flower the “J” with a practiced hand. Then I design my own bird, lopsided, but vivid, with a drooping beak that longs for spring. It perches on the flowering signature, takes the lizards in its mouth.

The shouting has ravaged his vocal chords, and there's no going back. His body, too, thins to gauntness, hollows under eyes that no longer focus, drooping earlobes amplifying nothing. I fill the room with his favorite smells, homemade applesauce that he complains tastes metallic, laundered shirts that billow around his shoulders. He sits in the reverberations of the glowing space heater, rocks in the chair his own father died in. He fingers pine cones and sea glass, spends hours rubbing the grooves in the vinyl of his boyhood, fingers the wound strings in a guitar so out of tune, even the birds fly away when he plays.\n\t\nI lean close when he tugs at my sleeve. He touches the knobs of my wrists, the swell of my knuckles. “I know it's you,” he whispers, pulling my ear to his lips. “Recognize you by the smell of the sea.” His voice cracks, soft as the wind through crabgrass, the sound of pain as deep as a heartbeat.\n\t\nHe's so light now, I could lift him, could carry him through the house the way he once carried us, hefted us on the nights we refused to climb the stairs to bed. \n\t\n“Tell her,” he says, in his loudest whisper. I press a finger to his mouth, feel the chap of his lips, but he brushes me away. “Tell her regret is the only evidence of life.”\n\t\n“Tell her yourself,” I try to say in the way my fingers press the flesh of his palm. “Tell her yourself,” I say in the smell of roasting beef, too tough, too stringy now for him to chew.\n\n[[I resort to letters. | Letters]]\n[[I resort to pictures. | Pictures]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Boring" tags="dimming" created="201604062205" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,290">My father believes darkness keeps the blindness at bay, and I've never known his bedroom to see the sun. At night, the wood has the same hollows as at mid-afternoon, and faded ovals suggest faded sepia photos, inscrutable both by day and by night. The room is full of boring things: tissues and tie tacks, vaguely patterned neckties, the same pair of shoes in slightly different shades. \n\t\nI slide aside a stack of faded boxer-briefs, and “The Most Boring Things” rests in a plastic sleeve under a layer of transparent undershirts.\n\t\n“I've never believed in angels,” Samara writes in the very last entry. “No matter how many times my mother assures me they exist.” She's written in a green ink pen, and her handwriting spikes and points like the tips of newly mown grass. The city in her descriptions is thick with pastels and new plaster, murals dazzling with colored glass. “It is,” she writes, “the best, most vibrant city.” Our parents, too, are unrecognizable. “My mother sings and bakes yeast breads.” Of our father she says, “He sees me more clearly than any other person. He knows exactly who I am.” \n\t\nI've watched my father finger the lines, wishing for braille. “She felt unseen and unloved,” he's said.\n\n[[I consider the remnants of my mother. | Mother]]\n[[I offer my father reassurance. | Reassurance]]\n</div><div tiddler="StorySettings" tags="" created="201804111716" modifier="twee" twine-position="16,16">jquery:off\nhash:off\nbookmark:on\nmodernizr:off\nundo:off\nobfuscate:off\nexitprompt:off\nblankcss:on\n</div><div tiddler=" Friends" tags="twilight" created="201604062221" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,150">Hilde the Green Ninja teaches mathematics at Hilltop Middle School, perched on a hill in the middle of a swamp. At the base of the hill, houses lean and tilt, streets buckle, water seeps. The mayor's council is working on rehabilitation, but each year this sector sinks another inch. The students barely look up when I come in. They scribble at worksheets, punch at calculators.\n\t\n“Imagine,” Hilde says to me out in the hallway, “A whole generation kept sleepless by nightmares of being swallowed by mud.”\n\t\nThe middle school is dimmer than I remember, the halls dank with the smell of blooming mold. \n\t\n“You look old,” Hilde says. “You look tired and old.”\n\t\n“Samara will look even older. Have you seen her?”\n\t\n“Does anyone ever see Samara?” Hilde checks her watch, scribbles on the cover of her grade book. “She's probably here right now.”\n\t\n“Like a ghost?” I say.\n\t\n“Like a memory.”\n\t\n“Our father is dying. He has last words.”\n\t\n“We all have last words.” A bell rings, flat and brittle. The students file into the hallway, the carpet squelching under their shoes. “You could try the others,” she says. “Arial or Patrick.”\n\t\nA boy tugs the hem of Hilde's blazer. He points at me. “Is that the magician?”\n\t\n“In a way,” she says.\n\n[[Arial, Unicorn Killer | Arial]]\n[[Patrick the Most Beautiful Painter | Patrick]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Forest" tags="shadows" created="201604062217" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,430">“The military garden must be in the forest,” I say, taking his hand to help him avoid the rotting planks in the footbridge, and wondering if were are the first, the only members of our family to stop on this tanbark, whether any of us have ever before examined the striated green of these ancient pines.\n\t\n“Nothing good ever comes of a forest,” my father says, whacking a tree with his cane and sending the bark flying.\n\t\nA woman in a red raincoat leads a one-eyed dog on a leash. “Hello,” she says, but my father ignores her.\n\t\n“There's that poem about how the world would end,” my father says. “You know, fire or ice?”\n\t\n“I've always thought darkness,” I say. “Although that probably means ice.”\n\t\n“Mosquitos,” my father says, stumbling over roots. “He didn't mention them.”\n\n[[We wander the tree houses. | Trees]]\n[[We follow the woman in the raincoat. | Raincoat]]\n</div><div tiddler=" Fountain" tags="shadows" created="201604062218" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,150">Weeping Fountain\n\nIt's too cold, still, for the Weeping Fountain, whose spigots are all silent cylinders of metal. The rain dots the pool, pecks at the angels. My mother believed that angels followed us, that we go through our lives with their hands on our backs.\n\t\n“When we approach death, it becomes easier to see them,” she said. “You'll see them watching you, ushering you to the next realm.”\n\t\nMy childhood was a constant terror of strangers, the unknown people at subway stops and newsstands. Anyone could be an angel, any hand on my shoulder, a summons to the afterlife.\n\t\n“Being a parent is one of the great wonders,” my father says. “Imagine bringing people into the world, raising them, teaching them. Then one day they lead you to places you've only dreamed about.” He trails his hand in the water while the angels cry around him, wings flung over faces, cloaks dangling in water.\n\t\n“Here I am,” he says, touching a flaming sword, a massive sandal. “Here I am finally, among our greatest warriors.”\n\n[[I take him home. | Home]]\n</div><div tiddler="Untitled Stylesheet 11" tags="stylesheet waiting" created="201804192132" modifier="twee" twine-position="441,861">/* Your story will use the CSS in this passage to style the page.\nGive this passage more tags, and it will only affect passages with those tags.\nExample selectors: */\n\nbody {\nbackground-color: #49127c;\t/* This affects the entire page */\n\t\n\t\n}\n\n#passages {\nbox-sizing:border-box;\npadding: 0 3%;\nmargin-top: 3%;\n}\n\n.passage {\nbackground-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);\nborder-radius: 1em;\nborder-style: solid;\nborder-width: 0px; \nborder-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);\nwidth: 75%;\nfont-family: Garamond, Times, Times New Roman, Georgia, serif;\nfont-color: black;\t/* This only affects passages */\nmargin: 0px;\npadding: 2em;\t/* This only affects passages */\n\t\n\t\n}\n.passage a {\n\t/* This affects passage links */\n\t\n\t\n}\n.passage a:hover {\n\t/* This affects links while the cursor is over them */\n\t\n\t\n}</div><div tiddler=" Theatre" tags="night" created="201604062237" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,570">The Theatre of the Living is a box department store with a balcony, a ring of seats around the outside walls. “Watch life while living life!” the slogan goes. Patrons can choose to complete their shopping or to climb the stairs to the plush chairs, buy a popcorn, settle in. Will that man buy generic or name brand? Will the mother give in and a buy a hamster for her son? Will the old couple choose to wait for their prescriptions or to come back later?”\n\t\nTorvin has chosen a seat near Home Furnishings. “Women love throw pillows,” he says. It's only a matter of time.”\n\t\n“I don't think Samara shops here,” I say.\n\t\n“Everyone shops here.” Torvin rattles his Raisinets.\n\t\nA family wanders through automotive wares. The father wants to buy everything, but the mother reins him in. The older child pushes the cart and reads from the list. The younger one hangs back, testing to see how far the distance can grow before the family notices. The parents round a corner, begin another aisle. Everyone looks bored. This is nothing special.\n\t\n“Your life is happening,” I could yell to them. “It's really happening.”\n\t\nTorvin slurps his soda, clamps my arm. “What'll it be, my friend?”\n\n[[I observe the bakery. | Bakery]]\n[[I visit electronics. | Electronics]]\n</div><div tiddler="StoryAuthor" tags="" created="201604062158" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,290"></div><div tiddler=" Outside" tags="twilight" created="201604062223" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,430">The flowers on sale outside the store have either died or not yet bloomed, spiky twigs in cellophane-wrapped pots. There are lawn scarecrows with the dried faces of dehydrated apples, welcome mats already muddied by strangers' shoes. The empty bus waits by the empty bus stop, its lights hazing the air a ghostly blue. Distant gunshots pop like fireworks. Sunset burns the sky ultraviolet and orange.\n\t\nArial, Unicorn Killer, drives a blue Saturn with a white driver's side door. Her gray hair twists into whorls like cobwebs. “You need help?” she asks, and then looks closely. “Of course you do.”\n\t\n“Our father is dying. I'm looking for Samara.”\n\t\nArial nods, holds her blue purse with powerful hands. “When they asked in fifth grade what we wanted to be, Samara said 'invisible.'”\n\t\n“He's frantic,” I say. “Losing his mind.”\n\t\nArial's key opens a metal door painted the same gray as the store. Inside is a tiny blue room rowed with time cards. “Death is like a chasm,” she says, punching her card in a responsible-looking square clock. “When our parents fall in, we see how our own feet hang over the edge.”\n\t\n“She'd want to see him.”\n\t\n“She called you Peacemaker, said you'd live your whole life without ever making it your own.”\n\t\n“What did you want to be?

He can't see the bursts of the neighbor's pink roses, can't hear the radios of the cars that pass. The nurses say his sense of smell is gone. His taste is going. When he speaks, his voice is the quiet creak of a hammock swaying.\n\t\nWhen I touch his shoulders, though, he stretches his arms, grasps at the air. “Is Samara here?” his fingers ask. “Promise,” he says with the tautness in his throat. He moves his head as if to stare into her eyes. “Promise me,” he says with the tension in his shoulders. “Promise me you've found her.”\n\t\nWhen I take his hands, he gapes, his mouth toothless and laughing. He throws his head back as if in thanks to the porch light, his joy a bullfrog in his throat. His hands clutch mine, pressing my knuckles, rubbing my wrists. I lean to let him touch my face, to brush my eyelids, sweep my forehead. “You've come back,” he says with his tender, desperate fingers, and I am Samara. For him, now, I will never be anyone other than Samara. I will be Samara for the rest of his days.\n\t\n“I tried,” I say. “I'm sorry. I tried.” I hold him close, and he trembles with joy. The damp of his tears wets the front of my shirt. “I'm so sorry.” I say.\n\t\nSoon, I will be the only one left to recognize the wind here, the arc of the afternoon light through the apple tree. “I'm sorry,” I say, but I touch his head, feel the bristle of his hair, as if I won't replay the ending in my mind forever, as if it were ever possible to say goodbye a final time.\t\n\n\n[[Remember | Beginning]]\n</div></div></body></html>
